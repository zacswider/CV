### Cell and Molecular Biology
_Extensive experience using insect and mammalian cell culture for knockdown screens, transformations, and protein expression. Extensive experience using CRISPR, reverse genetics, and RNAi in Drosophila. Extensive experience using microinjection for RNA/protein delivery in embryos._  
*Relevant publications:*  
- [Pericentrin is a Kinesin-1 Activator that Drives Centriole Motility](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.476023v1)
- [Fascetto interacting protein ensures proper cytokinesis and ploidy](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E18-09-0573)
- [Rop, the Sec1/Munc18 homolog in Drosophila, is required for furrow ingression and stable cell shape during cytokinesis](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/129/2/430/55753/Rop-the-Sec1-Munc18-homolog-in-Drosophila-is)

### Management and teamwork
_Co-managed a shared imaging facility (1 Bruker swept field confocal, 1 Prairie point scanning confocal, 1 Olympus FV1000 confocal, 1 Flamingo light sheet system) to maximize system use, minimize the impact of routine maintenance, and enhance system features. Educated new users on system features, analysis techniques, and best practices._

## Research experience
**2017 – 2022 | University of Wisconsin – Madison | Advisor:** [**Dr. William Bement**](https://bement.cellimaging.wisc.edu/)
- Used high speed live imaging and [computational analysis](https://github.com/zacswider/waveAnalysis/blob/main/README.md) and to study cell cycle regulation of cortical F-actin dynamics and GTPase crosstalk.

**2015 – 2017  | NHLBI, NIH | Advisor:** [**Dr. Nasser Rusan**](https://www.rusanlab.com/)
- Used live imaging, RNAi screening, reverse genetics, and biochemistry to determine direct functional protein interactions necessary for normal division of Drosophila neural stem cells.

**2013 – 2015 | University of California, Santa Cruz | Advisor:** [**Dr. William Sullivan**](https://sullivan.mcdb.ucsc.edu/)
- Used microscopy-based forward genetic screen in Drosophila embryos to identify and characterize the role of the Drosophila Sec1/Munc18 homolog during cytokinesis.

**2013 - 2013 | Oregon Institute of Marine Biology | Advisor:** [**Dr. George von Dassow**](http://gvondassow.com/Research_Site/Home.html)
- Used live imaging and IHC to identify a putative role for the _Micrura alaskensis_ homolog of Orthodenticle in promoting the differentiation of cells that make up the primary ciliated band.
