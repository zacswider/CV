_Graduate student in the [Bement Lab](https://bement.cellimaging.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Passionate about microscopes, fluorescence, and integrating modern computational image analysis into daily use. Self-motivated, enthusiastic team player seeking employment with a like-minded team._

## Technical Skills

### Computational
_Demonstrated use of Python and the FIJI macro language to develop analysis scripts for individual use as well as custom workflows for batch analysis. Practical experience with image filtering and segmentation for quantitative analysis and training machine learning models. This is currently my greatest area of both interest and growth._   

**Relevant GitHub repositories:**  
- Batch analysis approach to quantifying oscillatory dynamics in living cells [README](https://github.com/zacswider/waveAnalysis/blob/main/README.md)
- Interactive interface for visualizing frame-wise and cumulative optical flow [README](https://github.com/zacswider/opticalFlow/blob/main/README.md)
- FIJI macros for routine processing of confocal images [README](https://github.com/zacswider/Macros/blob/main/README.md)

### Microscopy
_Nine years of experience using classic and advanced fluorescence microscopy approaches to answer complex research questions. I offer a wealth of expertise in fixing, labeling, imaging, and analysis strategies as well as identifying and overcoming optical challenges and artifacts._

### Management and teamwork
_Co-managed a shared imaging facility (1 Bruker swept field confocal, 1 Prairie point scanning confocal, 1 Olympus FV1000 confocal, 1 Flamingo light sheet system) to maximize system use, minimize the impact of routine maintenance, and enhance system features. Educated new users on system features, analysis techniques, and best practices._
