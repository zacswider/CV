_Graduate student in the [Bement Lab](https://bement.cellimaging.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Passionate about microscopes, fluorescence, and integrating modern computational image analysis into daily use. Self-motivated, enthusiastic team player seeking employment with a like-minded team._

## Technical Skills

### Computational
_Four years of experience using Python to develop workflows for specific use and high-throughput analysis. This is currently my greatest area of both interest and growth._   
- Demonstrated use of the computing packages OpenCV, SciPy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.
- Experience working with large datasets (up to 12 TB) using Python-based tools for multi-dimensional visualization (Napari), managing larger-than-memory arrays (Dask), and GPU-accelerated image processing.
- Experience training and using deep learning approaches for image de-noising (Noise2Void, CARE), segmentation (StarDist, U-Net), and object detection (e.g., YOLOv2) using cloud computing resources.
- Experienced with environment control (conda, pip, venv), version control, and collaborative coding (GitHub).

### Microscopy
_Nine years of experience using classic and advanced fluorescence microscopy approaches to answer complex research questions. I offer a wealth of expertise in fixing, labeling, imaging, and analysis strategies as well as identifying and overcoming optical challenges and artifacts._  
- Extensive hands-on use of confocal (swept-field, spinning disk, and point-scanning), widefield, super-resolution (SIM, iSIM, STED, AiryScan), and light sheet microscopy.
- Deep understanding of image formation, resolving power, and limitations of different imaging modalities.
- Experience with diverse imaging platforms (Nikon, Olympus, Zeiss, Leica, Bruker) and associated image file formats.

### Cell and Molecular Biology
- Extensive experience using insect and mammalian cell culture for knockdown screens, transformations, and protein expression. 
- Broad background background of using CRISPR, reverse genetics, and RNAi in Drosophila. 
- Experienced microinjecting DNA, RNA and protein into _Drosophila_, _Xenopus_, and _Danio_ embryos.

### Management and teamwork
- Co-managed a shared imaging facility (1 Bruker swept field confocal, 1 Prairie point scanning confocal, 1 Olympus FV1000 confocal, 1 Flamingo light sheet system) to maximize system use, minimize the impact of routine maintenance, and enhance system features. Educated new users on system features, analysis techniques, and best practices. 
- Mentored 4 undergraduates over the course of 4 years to learn modern molecular biology and imaging approaches as well as scientific reading and writing proficiency.
